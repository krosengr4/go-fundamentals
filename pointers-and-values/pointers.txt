Pointer syntax
    - a := 42
    - b := &a

- We use pointers to hold memory addresses.
- This is so we can change the value of a, after b is declared as a pointer to a, and b would change as well.

- Derefrencing the pointer using the *
    - *b = "New value"

- Built in new() function creates a pointer to anonymous variable
    - c = new(int)

- When using pointers, we share memory

*** POINTERS ARE USED PRIMARILY TO SHARE MEMORY ***
*** USE COPIES WHENEVER POSSIBLE ***
