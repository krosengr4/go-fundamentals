- Let's say we have two variables:
    - var x int = 32
    - var y float32

- saying "y = x" to convert x to a float32 would give an error
    - this is because Go does not support implicit conversions

- type conversions allow for explicit conversions:
    - y = float32(x)
    - converts x into a type float32
