var a = 10
var b = 5

Addition
    - c := a + b
    - c = 15

Subtraction
    - c := a - b
    - c = 5

Multiplication
    - c := a * b
    - c = 50

Division
    - c := a / b 
    - c = 2

Integer Division
- It is important to note that when dividing in Go, the dividened will always be a whole number, even if their is a remainder
    - c := a / 3
    - c = 3 (the remainder would be lost)

Floating division
- if we divided two float types, we would get a float back if there is a remainder
    - d := 7.0 / 2.0
    - d = 3.5

Modulus(remainder of the division)
    - c := a % 3
    - c = 1
