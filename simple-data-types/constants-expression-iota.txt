- Constants are variables that can't be changed after it has been declared
    - Constants must always be assigned a value
    - Constants must be calculable at compile time (constants cannot be assigned a function)

- Examples:
    - const a = 42 (implicitly typed)
    - const b string = "Hello, world!" (explicitly typed)
    - const c = a (constants can be assigned to other constants)

Constant groups allow for multiple constants to be declared at one time
    - const (
        d = true
        e = 3.14159
    )

- In constant groups, if a constant is not assigned a value, Go will assign the value from above
    - const (
        a = "foo"
        b       //the value of b would be "foo" 
    )

*** iota ***
- the value of iota is related to a position in a constant group
- the value of iota resets when moved to another constant block
- example 
    const (
        b = iota        // 0 (first position)
        c               // 1 (second position)
        d = 3 * iota    // 6 (3 * 2nd position)
    )
