Variable declaration:
    - var myName string

Declaration and initialization:
    - var myName string = "Alejandro"

This is a little redundant.
Go is statically typed but also has a inference component so we can declare and init like:
    - var myName = "Gustavius III"

... and it gets even shorter using short declaration syntax:
    - myName := "Rodger"
    - the ":=" says that it is a Variable
