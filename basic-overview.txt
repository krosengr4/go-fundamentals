Programming language Go (GoLang) is primarily known and used as a backend language
Go excels in building server-side apps, APIs, microservices and distributed systems
This is due to its performance, concurrency features, and efficient resource management

Go is a statically typed language but does offer type inference (so you can declare variables without stating their data type)

Software platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform take advantage of the power and simplicity of Go to provide solid foundations for complex modern systems
