Variable declaration:
    - var myName string

Declaration and initialization:
    - var myName string = "Alejandro"

This is a little redundant.
Go is statically typed but also has a inference component so we can declare and init like:
    - var myName = "Gustavius III"

... and it gets even shorter using short declaration syntax:
    - myName := "Rodger"
    - the ":=" says that it is a Variable


And if you thought it couldn't get any quirkier...
Go allows for multiple variables to be initialized at once:
    - a, b := 10, 5
    - This would be like typing:
        - var a int = 10 || var a = 10 || a := 10
        - var b int = 5 || var b = 5 || b := 5
