- Simple data types are data types that contain one and can only contain one value
- Ex: Strings, numbers, booleans, and errors

- ***STRINGS***
    - "this is a string" (interperated string)
    - `this is also a string` (raw string)
    - raw strings will ignore escape characters such as \n
    - ex:
        - "hello \n this is on a new line"
        - `hello \n this will be on the same line`

- ***NUMBERS***
    - integers (int)
    - unsigned integers (uint)
    - floats (float32, float64)
    - Complex numbers (complex64, complex128)

- ***BOOLEAN***
    - true or false

- ***ERROR TYPE***
    - The error built-in interface type is the conventional interface for representing an error
    - The nil value representing no error
    - type error interface {
        Error() string
    }

- Error type:
    - The error built-in interface type is the conventional interface for representing an error condition.
    - The nil value(absence of a value) represents no error
